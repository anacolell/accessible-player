00:00:03.195 --> 00:00:05.960
(ANA) About two hours from Athens,
in the northern Peloponnese,

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.840
is Rira Vineyards, in a landscape
where the mountains and the sea

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.720
come together.

00:00:12.698 --> 00:00:16.320
The vineyard is located in
Aigialeia, a coastal region

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.040
overlooking the Corinthian Gulf.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.600
Rira is often described as one of
the most beautiful vineyards

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.720
in Greece.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.640
Today we meet Anastasis,
the vineyards’ owner,

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.240
to learn more about this place
and the wine they make here.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.840
Anastasi, thank you for meeting
with us today.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.000
Would you like to tell us a little
bit about yourself and the vineyard?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.920
(ANASTASIS) Hi, of course, welcome.
So, my name is Anastasis.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.440
Welcome to Rira Vineyards.
Rira is the actual name of the place,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.909
so it’s always been called Rira.

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:50.160
The whole area is 120 hectares,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.360
The actual vineyard surface
is 25 hectares

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.560
and we also have about
3500 olive trees planted around

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.720
the vineyard.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.720
(ANA) Very nice. So, what makes this
place special?

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.040
Can you tell us what sets Rira
apart in terms of winemaking?

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.160
(ANASTASIS) Yes, of course, it’s
basically everything you can

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.920
see around you here.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.160
It’s several elements.
They say that the best winemaker

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.880
is actually the weather

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.680
and it’s something that you
can practically see here.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.760
So, one element is the close

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.880
proximity to the sea which helps
cool down the grapes in the summer.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.760
Another aspect is the
elevation.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.320
The higher up you are, the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.960
better it is for the grapes
because it also cools them down.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.520
Another aspect is the slope,

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.760
so that the water actually
free flows

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.560
and it doesn’t cause disease
pressure.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.440
Another element is the
mountains you saw before,

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.000
the tall mountains of the
Peloponnese, they protect us from

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.720
the hot winds from Africa.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.680
And, of course, it’s one of

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.880
the few areas in Greece that
actually has a northern aspect,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.080
which means the northern
side of the vineyard is also

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.600
a bit cooler,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.880
so we’ve planted accordingly
summer grape varieties.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.080
(ANA) So, where is the North?

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.120
(ANASTASIS) Everything you see from
this side is the North.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.480
(ANA) Okay, so, which wine would you
recommend to someone that’s

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.400
trying Rira wines for the first time?

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.160
(ANASTASIS) Well, I could recommend them all, of course.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.200
But if something would stand out 
it would be a local red variety

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.760
we have here,

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.720
which is called Mavrodafni,
which literally translated means

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.880
“black laurel”

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.720
and it’s a very typical red
variety from the area, usually done

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.680
in a sweet style,

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.040
but nowadays it’s done in a
dry style.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.280
(ANA) I see. Well, Anastasi, thank you

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.480
so much for meeting us today
and showing us around.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.800
We hope to come back very soon

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.520
 but before we go, could we meet
the employee of the month?

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.200
I would like to hear her thoughts.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.334
(ANASTASIS) Yes, of course, we’ll go
straight to her.

00:02:45.334 --> 00:02:46.867
(ANA) Great, let’s go.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.032
(ANASTASIS) And introducing the employee of the month.

00:02:54.032 --> 00:02:56.831
Fifi.
